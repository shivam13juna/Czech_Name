# This program is meant to classify gender given name.

Program has been trained with Indian names, around 14k with almost equal gender diversity. The reason why indian names were chosen because not only they capture the latent structure differentiating a man's or a woman's name but also that they can be quite long. 

### Following feature engineering was done on dataset:
  1. Make a set of all the characters of Czech and [Indian Names](https://gist.github.com/mbejda/7f86ca901fe41bc14a63), for doing one hot encoding. 
  2. Break each name in a list, and assign each character to a one hot encoded vector.
  3. For label we're assigning a list of [1, 0] for male and [0, 1] for female. This will be used as we're using *categorical crossentropy* method, as our criterion. 
 
### Structure of Model used:
I'm using *Bidirectional LSTM of around 524 units with 2 layers*, as it makes sense an algorithm if feeded from end of a name, will learn quite well, and increase in accuracy was observed. So no reason why it shouldn't be used
I'm also using callbacks in Keras model, Early_Stopping with patience 10, and ReduceLROnPlateau, truth be told, model isn't that complicated we didn't need to use this, but no harm in using them


### Accuracy
We're getting accuracy of around **80 to 85%**, not bad since we're not explicitly training on Czech names, still we get that, that's pretty good.
